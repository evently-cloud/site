    <div class="bg-darkBG p-4">Event Sourcing is an application data model that record events that have happened to an entity in a permanent log. Then, when the application needs to determine the current state of an entity, it “replays” the relevant events and calculates the state from these events. When the application wants to add a new event for an entity, it can use this current state calculation to decide if the event should be recorded.</div>
